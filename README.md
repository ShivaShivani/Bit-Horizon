# Bit-Horizon

Functionalities:-

    -> Our application is a web based application, which is used to recommend music to the users who can register and log in to the application with the help of facebook, google+ and twitter.
    
    -> Once the user is logged in, if he is a new user then the application recommends tracks to the user based on the artists he liked in his facebook.
    
    -> Also our application shows the top 10 trending songs based on the twitter data(Number of tweets, retweets and likes for a particular song).
    
    -> We also added a feature for the user to add comments to a particular song.


Technologies:-

    -> We have used Facebook API, Twitter API and Google+ API to help the users to register and log into the application.

    -> We have pulled the users info regarding the artists he likes from the facebook to provide suggestions to a new user.

    -> We have collected various tweets, likes, retweets, users based on the #NowPlaying hash tag and used NLP to find the songs and artists name out of the whole tweet.We have performed Sentiment Analysis on the tweets and based on that we are suggesting the songs.

    -> Once the tweets are collected we have written algorithm to find the top 10 trending songs based on the number of tweets, likes and retweets a song has got.

    -> We are using MongoLab as our database.

    -> Our middleware is Java.

    -> Our frontend is HTML, CSS and bootstrap.
