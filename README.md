# Bit-Horizon

Functionalities:-

    ->Our application is a web based application, which is used to recomend music to the users who can register and log in to the application with the help of facebook, google+ and twitter.

    ->Once the user is logged in, if he is a new user then the application recomends tracks to the user based on the artists he liked in his facebook.

    ->Also our application showes the top 10 trending songs based on the twitter data(Number of tweets, retweens and likes for a particular song).

    -> We also added a feature for the user to add comments to a particular song.

Technologies:-

    -> We have used Facebook API, Twitter API and Google+ API to help the users to register and log into the application.

    -> We have pulled the users info regarding the artists he likes from the facebook to provide suggestions to a new user.

    -> We have collected various tweets based on the #NowPlaying hash tag and used NLP to find the songs and artists name out of the whole tweet.

    -> Once the tweets are collected we have written algorithem to find the top 10 trending songs based on the number of tweets, likes and retweets a song has got.

    -> We are using MongoLab as our database.

    -> Our middleware is Java.

    -> Our frontend is HTML, CSS and bootstrap.
